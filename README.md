# 2048stable
Uses stablebaselines3 to train an ai to play 2048. 
This is currently my most significant project, and went through multiple iterations and modules before settling on StableBaselines3.
Sadly, I have found that 2048 is harder to train a net on than one would expect, and have yet to see a game won.
That said, it is still my current proudest accomplishment as a coder.

To train, use learn.py. Using the --showgame argument will show a playthrough of the html game at regular intervals. 
Constants can be adjusted in defs.py.

2048 belongs to Gabriele Cirulli, none of the code in the 2048-master folder is mine.
