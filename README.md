# 2048stable
Uses stablebaselines3 to train an ai to play 2048. 
To train, use learn.py. Using the --showgame argument will show a playthrough of the html game at regular intervals. 
Constants can be adjusted in defs.py.

2048 belongs to Gabriele Cirulli, none of the code in the 2048-master folder is mine.
